# RenewableFuelModel

A renewable fuel production model in SpineOpt at electricity bidding zone granularity over Denmark, Norway and Sweden.

It was intended to soft-link it to Balmorel (https://github.com/balmorelcommunity/Balmorel) to assess impacts on the energy system.
It is therefore advised to add investment options of electricity generating technologies if using this as a stand-alone model.

Note, this was developed using a very old version of SpineOpt and SpineToolbox:
- SpineOpt v0.6.3
- SpineToolbox v0.6.5

These tools can be found at https://github.com/spine-tools
