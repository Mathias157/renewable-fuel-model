# RenewableFuelModel

A renewable fuel production model in SpineOpt at electricity bidding zone granularity over Denmark, Norway and Sweden. This model was used in the following publication:

Mathias Berg Rosendal, Marie Münster, Rasmus Bramstoft,Renewable fuel production and the impact of hydrogen infrastructure—A case study of the Nordics,Energy,2024,131234,ISSN 0360-5442,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2024.131234. (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360544224010077)

The results (DataOutput.sqlite) can be downloaded from

It was intended to soft-link it to Balmorel (https://github.com/balmorelcommunity/Balmorel) to assess impacts on the energy system.
It is therefore advised to add investment options of electricity generating technologies if using this as a stand-alone model.

Note, this was developed using a very old version of SpineOpt and SpineToolbox:
- SpineOpt v0.6.3
- SpineToolbox v0.6.5
