# RenewableFuelModel
A renewable fuel production model in SpineOpt with 11 generalised nodes (Z01-Z11).
Note that its intended use is in a soft-link with Balmorel (https://github.com/balmorelcommunity/Balmorel) for assessing impacts on the energy system.
It is therefore adviced to add investment options of electricity generating technologies if using this model as stand-alone.

Note, this was developed using a very old version of SpineOpt and SpineToolbox:
- SpineOpt v0.6.3
- SpineToolbox v0.6.5

These tools can be found at https://github.com/spine-tools
